# SellAiArt Enabling AI Artists to Create and Profit

### Overview

SellAiArt is a web platform designed to empower AI artists by providing tools to generate, showcase, and sell their AI-generated artwork. It bridges the gap between artistic creativity and commerce, offering a seamless experience for artists to monetize their work.

### Motivation

Inspired by Botto, a decentralized AI artist that combines algorithmic art generation with human judgment, SellAiArt was conceived to simplify and democratize AI art creation. The platform focuses on convenience and scalability, allowing artists to focus on creativity while the platform handles storage, presentation, and transactions.
